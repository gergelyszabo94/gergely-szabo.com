                I have started putting this together to help me with trading and
                the many questions I receive during trade negotiations. I will
                try to add more content and expand it continuously. What I am
                planning to write about are: how I started trading, how you can
                start trading, how to get accurate prices, how to avoid
                scammers, how to trade with me and more. I divided it into
                sections for better navigation and “linkability”.

        <h4 class="text-center">My first ever trade</h4>
        <p>
            My first ever trade was well before I have actually become a trader,
            but it’s still quite memorable. Back in 2013, when
            <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/"
                >/r/GlobalOffensive/</a
            >
            had only a few thousand members and top posts had around 200 upvotes
            I was very active there. The first operation nicknamed “Payback” was
            still underway and the passes were discounted. The now famous
            <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/etherfast">Etherfast</a>
            made a post on reddit, giving away passes and I was one of the recipients.

        <h4 class="text-center">Sniffing around for business</h4>
        <p>
            On the August of that year Valve introduced “skins” and I started
            sniffing for business. Honestly I was at the right place at the
            right time. The price of cases and and what you would consider junk
            now were quite high and I could cash in on the early skin fever. By
            just playing the game, I received drops like anyone else and sold
            them on the market to gain some wallet balance. At that time it was
            possible to buy a weapon case key just by salling a few drops.

        />
        <p>
            As you can see, at the beginning even trading cards and simple
            everyday drops were kind of expensive. Weapon cases, especially the
            Bravo case which was being sold for €1-2 weeks after its release.
            This allowed me some slow, but steady gains.

        <h4 class="text-center">Market Sniping</h4>
        <p>
            I started figuring out how the community market worked and it was
            not long after when I started making a bit of a business out of it.
            In hindsight I have to admit It was pretty lame and inefficient. I
            was sniping on the market. I would sit and watch the newly listed
            items on the market. Every now and then I would see an item listed
            on a somewhat lower price than usual. To get them before anyone else
            I had to know the prices for most of the items so I could click
            “buy” without having to check the price every time. At most times I
            would earn a cent or two by listing the item on a higher price.
            Sometime I got more lucky and earned 10-20 cents or more even. Of
            course these transactions are pretty laughable as I literality had
            to sit there and spend hours to find some decent deals. Should have
            found a better thing to waste my time on at the end of the summer,
            huh? Anyways, here are some of the more profitable ones:
        </p>

            title="Earned 22 cents on this transaction, I can still recall the thrill of purchasing an item under price."
            cl="mb-2"

        />
        <br />
        <p>
            I managed to work my way up to about €50 after a volatile day of the
            bravo case. If I remember correctly it stopped dropping at the rate
            it was supposed to after just a day, driving the price up. Meanwhile
            some people kept listing them on seemingly random prices. Here is a
            snippet from that day:
        </p>
        <CenteredImage
            src="/img/trading/bravoday.png"
            title="One, if not the best of my profits during market sniping."
            cl="mb-3"
        />
        <p>
            Not long after this I stopped market sniping. Nothing really
            happened for months, except I got some drops and sold those as well.
            Later I tried automating sniping with some relative success. When
            bravo cases were somewhere around €0.10 in price and the operation
            ended I decided to invest most of my money in them. I bought up 400
            of them waiting for the opportunity to make some profit. The case’s
            price quickly started to surge in waves. I sold some at €0.20 and
            waited all the way up to €1 with some. All in all it was one of the
            events that later allowed me to enter trading as well.
        </p>
        <h4 class="text-center">Trading</h4>
        <p>
            I got into trading through reddit. I was lurking around on
            <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensiveTrade/"
                >/r/GlobalOffensiveTrade/</a
            >
            for before I made my first move. I bought some keys and tried sniping
            “quicksells” as fast as possible. I was not very good at it, because
            back then I didn’t know about trading tools, etc. I had to manually put
            in every key, count and recount it before sending an offer. That put
            me in a considerable disadvantage. Still, I caught some cheap stuff that
            I put right back to reddit and lounge. I have done this for a while and
            kept improving my methods. For example I set up a system that looked
            for the “qs” and “quicksell” keywords in newly created posts on reddit
            and notified me. In case you are still in doubt, yes I was a dirty “quickbuyer”.
            Back then it did not have that bad of a reputation though, it was considered
            a normal and in a way essential part of trading. Then came the “go trad
            men”, “65% quickbuy” and similar russian guys from lounge ruining it
            for everyone.
        </p>
        <p>
            Valve’s policies against fraud hurt this part of trading the most.
            Putting newly bought keys on hold slowed everything down to a halt.
            I had to adapt and change the way I traded so I grew my funds and
            expanded my reach by looking for trades on other sites as well. With
            some minor adjustments the way I traded is still essentially what I
            do today. To learn about what that exactly is just scroll down and
            read the next section.

                Unlike most other big traders who deal with top float items, items with rare and expensive stickers, and blue gems
                I chose a different path.
                Rather than dealing with rare collectors' stuff, I trade more common items and go for the quantity.
                I used to advertise on CSGOLounge, CSGOTRADERS.NET, reddit, in some Steam groups and on the CS:GO Steam forum.
                I have also built a clientele of 2000 Steam friends and
                <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/gergelyszabotrading">a trading group</a>
                with 8000 members.
                I rely solely on the latter two now.
                In my posts I usually ask for downgrades with overpay, but in reality I do all kinds of trades, low
                to high, high to high, cheap items for an expensive, and more.
            </p>

        <div class="col-lg-6 mr-auto">
            <p>
                Trading all kinds of items allows me to interact with all kinds of people.
                I try to have as many successful trades every day as possible.
                I spend hours a day taking, considering, then countering or accepting offers, chatting with people,
                writing comments, updating trading posts and whatnot. I describe my workflow below.
                Item to item trading used to be my life, it's still a big part of it but I prefer
                a better work-life balance and also spending time on writing code.

            You can find a video below of me getting home, sitting down to my PC and going to inbox zero with trades, chat messages, friend request and all while explaining what I do.
            One of my friends said that it's really chilling to watch me go through my trades and I should be streaming it so I decided that I will do a recording.
            I had several recordings up on YouTube and they became quite popular during the first lockdowns when people had nothing better to do.
            I have done some live streams too, the recording are available
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkDNavvHkCFHFCZ2bmG4zzw">on my channel.</a>
            I stopped making videos since I did not enjoy making them too much, making them took up a lot of my time
            and I do not need the attention / volume of people contacting me through here.
            The video might be educational for aspiring traders and interesting for random folks, enjoy!
