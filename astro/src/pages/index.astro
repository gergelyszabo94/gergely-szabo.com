				Mastodon is a decentralized social media platform. Unlike FB and others it's not controled by a 
				single entity. Anyone can setup their own server and join the 
				<a href="https://fediverse.party/">Fediverse</a> via a protocol called 
				<a href="https://activitypub.rocks/">ActivityPub</a>, or 
				<a href="https://joinmastodon.org/">sign up to an existing server</a>.
				Since the servers are connected and I am being a geek I decided to
				host my own server at <a href="https://mstdn.gergely-szabo.com/@gery">mstdn.gergely-szabo.com/@gery</a>.
				Mine is a single user server, sign ups are disabled.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you already have an account elsewhere you can search for gery@mstdn.gergely-szabo.com 
				and hopefully you will find me and give me a follow. I don't post a whole lot but I reboost 
				interesting stuff from others, may it be related to the war in Ukraine, information security,
				internet trends, etc. I am hoping it will become more popular and I can use it as my primary platform.

				Twitter is definitely the social media platform that I spend the most time on.
				I have a split personality there, I only really tweet about my trading extension and CS:GO trading related topics.
				However I follow a diverse group of people who tweet about the war in Ukraine, national security, information security, 
				privacy, free speach, etc.
				I also keep track of other CS:GO traders, sites, events through Twitter.
				<br>
				Since Elon took over, I try limiting the time I spend browsing Twitter, I really don't like the direction it's going with
				the algorithm taking a more and more central role, resctriction of third party applications, etc.
				<br>
				My DMs are open if you want to contact me for business or trading, feel free to follow me!
				You can find me <a href="https://twitter.com/gergelyszabo94">@gergelyszabo94</a>

				I am on Instagram since mid 2018 and usually post travel photos when I go on an adventure with my wife.
				I find Instram to be a good way of keeping track of what your friends are up to.
				Sometimes when I have a few minutes idling I let the algorithm show me some reels that usually end up being about 
				dogs, furniture or attractive women.
				Give me <a href="https://www.instagram.com/gergelyszabo94/">@gergelyszabo94</a> a follow if you are interested!

				Facebook. Everyone is on it, most use it, some are addicted to it.
				<a href="https://www.facebook.com/gergelyszabo1994">I am</a> not very active, I mostly use it to
				keep contact with family, occasionally you can find me posting travel pics. I am linking to it for verification too.
				I am being impersonated on FB and they suck at dealing with impersonation. This way you know
				not to trust anyone claiming to be me that is not this account. I don't have any other FB accounts.
			</p>
			<p>
				I only accept friend request from people I actually know, so there is no point in adding
				me if you don't know me! Messages from strangers also remain unseen.
				If you must contact me please use other methods.
