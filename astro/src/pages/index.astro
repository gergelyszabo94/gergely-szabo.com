					Hi there! My name is Gergely Szabo also known as "GeRy" by
					many. I am a professional CS:GO trader.

				<p>
					I am the owner and lead developer of the

					I also used to make

			<div class="col-lg-4 mr-auto">
				<p>
					This website was created because of my fascination with
					technology and so you can find out more about me in an

						Movies - IMDb
					</h3>
					<p>
						Being a huge fan and consumer of film I opened up my
						<LinkOnLightBackground
							href="http://www.imdb.com/user/ur27358290"
							text="IMDb profile"
						/>, where you can
						check out what
						I watch, want to watch and all kinds of detailed statistics about my viewing and rating habits.
						I could write an essay on my methodology of rating movies, but my most basic rule is if I think a
						movie was "worth watching" I give it a rating of 6 or higher, below that are "time wasters".

						Videos - YouTube
					</h3>
					<p>YouTube videos are the part of my everyday life. At the time of writing I am 
						<LinkOnLightBackground
							href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkDNavvHkCFHFCZ2bmG4zzw/channels"
							text="subscribed to 70 channels. "
						/>
						The topics of these channels varies from workout to rocket science with, music, comedy,
						science and tech in between. Some of my favourites are

						<LinkOnLightBackground

						and

						/>.
					</p>
					<p>
						I used to make my own videos and do live streams as well, they are about CS:GO trading.
						I don't make videos anymore but

						Music - Apple Music
					</h3>
					<p>
						My music listening habits justify a monthly fee for a subscription service,
						I consider it one of the best values all around.
						I listen to lots of film scores, rock, pop, classical, 80s retro, some electric.
						I have been using Google Play Music since 2013, used Spotify for a while and now Apple Music.
						You can see what I listen to on 
						<LinkOnLightBackground

						You should also be able to follow me.

					Books - goodreads
				</h2>
				<p>
					I don't listen to nearly as many audiobooks as I used to, but I catalog every book I read (khm.. listen to) in my
					<LinkOnLightBackground
						href="https://www.goodreads.com/gergelyszabo"
						text="Goodreads library"
					/>.
					Favourite topics include history, biography, business, finance, technology, science, politics and
					philosophy. So mostly everything non-fiction.
					I can wholeheartedly recommend goodreads, it is an awesome way to manage your readings, explore new
					authors or stay motivated with a

				Mastodon is a decentralized social media platform. Unlike FB and others it's not controled by a 
				single entity. Anyone can setup their own server and join the 
				<a href="https://fediverse.party/">Fediverse</a> via a protocol called 
				<a href="https://activitypub.rocks/">ActivityPub</a>, or 
				<a href="https://joinmastodon.org/">sign up to an existing server</a>.
				Since the servers are connected and I am being a geek I decided to
				host my own server at <a href="https://mstdn.gergely-szabo.com/@gery">mstdn.gergely-szabo.com/@gery</a>.
				Mine is a single user server, sign ups are disabled.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you already have an account elsewhere you can search for gery@mstdn.gergely-szabo.com 
				and hopefully you will find me and give me a follow. I don't post a whole lot but I reboost 
				interesting stuff from others, may it be related to the war in Ukraine, information security,
				internet trends, etc. I am hoping it will become more popular and I can use it as my primary platform.

				Twitter is definitely the social media platform that I spend the most time on.
				I have a split personality there, I only really tweet about my trading extension and CS:GO trading related topics.
				However I follow a diverse group of people who tweet about the war in Ukraine, national security, information security, 
				privacy, free speach, etc.
				I also keep track of other CS:GO traders, sites, events through Twitter.
				<br>
				Since Elon took over, I try limiting the time I spend browsing Twitter, I really don't like the direction it's going with
				the algorithm taking a more and more central role, resctriction of third party applications, etc.
				<br>
				My DMs are open if you want to contact me for business or trading, feel free to follow me!
				You can find me <a href="https://twitter.com/gergelyszabo94">@gergelyszabo94</a>

				I am on Instagram since mid 2018 and usually post travel photos when I go on an adventure with my wife.
				I find Instram to be a good way of keeping track of what your friends are up to.
				Sometimes when I have a few minutes idling I let the algorithm show me some reels that usually end up being about 
				dogs, furniture or attractive women.
				Give me <a href="https://www.instagram.com/gergelyszabo94/">@gergelyszabo94</a> a follow if you are interested!

				I have been active on reddit for about 10 years now, naturally I joined 
				dozens of communties over the years. The topics I follow include: world news,
				technology, finance, war, space, automotive, dicussions.
				I check it at least twice a day, or when I have a few minures to procrastinate.

				Facebook. Everyone is on it, most use it, some are addicted to it.
				<a href="https://www.facebook.com/gergelyszabo1994">I am</a> not very active, I mostly use it to
				keep contact with family, occasionally you can find me posting travel pics. I am linking to it for verification too.
				I am being impersonated on FB and they suck at dealing with impersonation. This way you know
				not to trust anyone claiming to be me that is not this account. I don't have any other FB accounts.
			</p>
			<p>
				I only accept friend request from people I actually know, so there is no point in adding
				me if you don't know me! Messages from strangers also remain unseen.
				If you must contact me please use other methods.

				I don't really use it since I became self-emloyed, but I needed something
				to complete the second row of social icons so it looks nice and pleases my OCD.
				You can check <a href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/gergelyszabo1994'>what kind of work I have done</a>
				before I went all-in on trading.
